Day - 1 

I started my daily tasks routine, but I ended up procrastinating so much today, but what I did today is 

- Revision Python Basic (due to exam month, I need to brush up basics)

- Begun Learning SQL (but not much done yet on first day)

- Data Science (no tasks done on first day)

See Tomorrow, Bye!!!
